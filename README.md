# FileHub
File database to allow users to Upload, View, Download, and Comment on files. Written in React with Semantic-UI.

# Common Developer Requirements
1. Install Git in order to clone this repository and eventually commit any changes you may make

    _OSX_

      1. Install Brew at https://brew.sh
      2. Run `brew install git` in your favorite terminal

    _Linux_

      1. Open your favorite terminal and make sure git is installed
      2. If it is not, use your distro's package manager to install it

    _Windows_

      1. After enabling the Linux subsystem (Google it), check that git is installed
      2. If it is not, `apt-get install git` should be sufficient to get it installed

2. Install some UNIX compatible editor (e.g.) Sublime Text, Vscode, Atom, vim, etc.


# Testing and Development

## Choosing your developer environment
FileHub is built primarily upon JavaScript and related toolings.
In theory these are multi-platform, however, you will find a much easier workflow while using them in UNIX-like environments.
If using Windows, I __highly__ recommend using the Ubuntu Subsystem that provides you with a Linux Bash terminal.

### Installation
1. Install Node and npm in order to install dependencies, compile/transpile react, and run our server

    _OSX_

      1. After installing Brew, Open your favorite terminal and run `brew install node`
      2. Check that it is installed with `node -v`. This should return a version number in your terminal

    _Linux_

      1. Open your favorite terminal and install using this [reference](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
      2. Check that it is installed with `node -v`. This should return a version number in your terminal

    _Windows_

      1. In Bash, run `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -` then `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
      2. Check that it is installed with `node -v`


2. Clone this repository
  1. In your favorite terminal, navigate to whatever directory you want to store this repo in
  2. Run `git clone https://github.com/cephalization/kijenzi-kipakiaji`

3. Install package dependencies
  1. In your favorite terminal, navigate into the newly cloned kijenzi-kipakiaji directory
  2. Run `npm install`. This should download a bunch of packages in the node_modules folder. __Make sure this exists__

From this point on, there should not be any platform disparities as far as development goes.

### Application Debugging
All of these steps should be completed in the root of the `kijenzi-kipakiaji` directory

1. cd to the kijenzi-kipakiaji root directory and run `npm install`.
2. Launch the API Server
  - If you do not care about logging, run `node server.js &`
  - If you do care about logging, open a new window/tab/whatever and run `node server.js`
3. Run `npm start`. This will open a browser with the front-end loaded. It will refresh whenever changes are saved to any react related file.
4. Connect to http://localhost:3000/ in your favorite browser if it is not open already

If changes are made to any react files, the site will automatically refresh.
Do not do any performance testing on these debug builds.

### Application Performance Testing
To test a production-optimized version of the application, run the following commands.
1. cd to the kijenzi-kipakiaji root directory and run `npm install`.
2. build the latest front-end with `npm run build`
3. launch the server with `node server.js`
4. Connect to http://localhost:8080/ in your favorite browser

Running the application in this way is more straightforward and performant,  but the build takes a while to complete.
Use the __Application Debugging__ steps above while developing.
